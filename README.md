🔓 Cracking the Code Game – Instructions
Objective:
You and your partner are cybersecurity researchers tasked with cracking a passcode as quickly as possible. You will work through a series of challenges, modifying your algorithm at each step. The goal is to observe how password complexity affects cracking time and understand how to make passwords more secure.

📌 Step 1: Plan Your Algorithm

Before coding, you must first sketch out your strategy!

Draw your algorithm on the whiteboard.
Think about:
What type of loop will you use?
How will you guess numbers?
When will your program stop?
Discuss your approach with your partner and get approval from your instructor before coding.
🚀 Challenge 1: Crack a 4-Digit Passcode

Goal: Write an algorithm to find a randomly generated 4-digit integer passcode.

Steps:
Use the starter code provided.
Implement an algorithm that searches for the passcode (brute-force or smarter method).
Run your program and record how long it takes to crack the passcode.
If you finish early, try to optimize your approach.
🔎 Discussion Questions:
How does your algorithm work? (Explain the steps)
What is the fastest way to crack the password?
What are real-world examples of this type of attack?
🔥 Challenge 2: Increase the Passcode Length

Goal: Modify your program to increase the passcode length and analyze the effect.

Steps:
Change the passcode size from 4 digits to 6, then 8 digits.
Run your program and record the cracking time for each case.
Observe how the time changes as the passcode length increases.
🔎 Discussion Questions:

3. Why does it take longer to crack a longer password?

4. What strategies do people use to protect their PIN numbers?

🛡️ Challenge 3: Introduce Letters into the Password

Goal: Modify your algorithm to crack a password containing both numbers and letters.

Steps:
Change the passcode format to include:
Numbers (0-9)
Letters (a-d) (You can expand this later!)
Comment out your digit-only cracking algorithm and write a new algorithm to handle both numbers and letters.
Run your program and observe the new time to crack the password.
🔎 Discussion Questions:

5. How did adding letters change your algorithm?

6. Did this increase the difficulty of cracking the password? Why?

7. How do strong passwords prevent brute-force attacks?

🏆 Final Challenge: Custom Password Complexity

Goal: Experiment with different password complexities and analyze security impact.

Steps:
Try longer passwords (10+ characters) with more letters (a-z).
Try randomizing the search instead of brute force.
Try optimizing your algorithm to make it smarter.
🔎 Final Reflection Questions, answer at least 2 of these questions for reflection:
What type of passwords are hardest to crack?
How can companies prevent brute-force attacks?
If you were a hacker, how would you improve your approach?
What are ethical concerns about password cracking?
🏁 Conclusion & Competition
Compare your fastest cracking time with other teams.
Discuss real-world applications and how cybersecurity protects us.
Reflect on the importance of strong passwords.
